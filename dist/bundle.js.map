In IE and Safari, we have to guess source file names\n\t * by searching for function bodies inside all page scripts. This will not\n\t * work for scripts that are loaded cross-domain.\n\t * Here be dragons: some function names may be guessed incorrectly, and\n\t * duplicate functions may be mismatched.\n\t *\n\t * TraceKit.computeStackTrace should only be used for tracing purposes.\n\t * Logging of unhandled exceptions should be done with TraceKit.report,\n\t * which builds on top of TraceKit.computeStackTrace and provides better\n\t * IE support by utilizing the window.onerror event to retrieve information\n\t * about the top of the stack.\n\t *\n\t * Note: In IE and Safari, no stack trace is recorded on the Error object,\n\t * so computeStackTrace instead walks its *own* chain of callers.\n\t * This means that:\n\t *  * in Safari, some methods may be missing from the stack trace;\n\t *  * in IE, the topmost function in the stack trace will always be the\n\t *    caller of computeStackTrace.\n\t *\n\t * This is okay for tracing (because you are likely to be calling\n\t * computeStackTrace from the function you want to be the topmost element\n\t * of the stack trace anyway), but not okay for logging unhandled\n\t * exceptions (because your catch block will likely be far away from the\n\t * inner function that actually caused the exception).\n\t *\n\t */\n\tTraceKit.computeStackTrace = (function computeStackTraceWrapper() {\n\t    var sourceCache = {};\n\t\n\t    /**\n\t     * Attempts to retrieve source code via XMLHttpRequest, which is used\n\t     * to look up anonymous function names.\n\t     * @param {string} url URL of source code.\n\t     * @return {string} Source contents.\n\t     */\n\t    function loadSource(url) {\n\t        if (!TraceKit.remoteFetching) { //Only attempt request if remoteFetching is on.\n\t            return '';\n\t        }\n\t        try {\n\t            var getXHR = function() {\n\t                try {\n\t                    return new window.XMLHttpRequest();\n\t                } catch (e) {\n\t                    // explicitly bubble up the exception if not found\n\t                    return new window.ActiveXObject('Microsoft.XMLHTTP');\n\t                }\n\t            };\n\t\n\t            var request = getXHR();\n\t            request.open('GET', url, false);\n\t            request.send('');\n\t            return request.responseText;\n\t        } catch (e) {\n\t            return '';\n\t        }\n\t    }\n\t\n\t    /**\n\t     * Retrieves source code from the source code cache.\n\t     * @param {string} url URL of source code.\n\t     * @return {Array.<string>} Source contents.\n\t     */\n\t    function getSource(url) {\n\t        if (!isString(url)) return [];\n\t        if (!hasKey(sourceCache, url)) {\n\t            // URL needs to be able to fetched within the acceptable domain.

In IE and Safari, we have to guess source file names\n * by searching for function bodies inside all page scripts. This will not\n * work for scripts that are loaded cross-domain.\n * Here be dragons: some function names may be guessed incorrectly, and\n * duplicate functions may be mismatched.\n *\n * TraceKit.computeStackTrace should only be used for tracing purposes.\n * Logging of unhandled exceptions should be done with TraceKit.report,\n * which builds on top of TraceKit.computeStackTrace and provides better\n * IE support by utilizing the window.onerror event to retrieve information\n * about the top of the stack.\n *\n * Note: In IE and Safari, no stack trace is recorded on the Error object,\n * so computeStackTrace instead walks its *own* chain of callers.\n * This means that:\n *  * in Safari, some methods may be missing from the stack trace;\n *  * in IE, the topmost function in the stack trace will always be the\n *    caller of computeStackTrace.\n *\n * This is okay for tracing (because you are likely to be calling\n * computeStackTrace from the function you want to be the topmost element\n * of the stack trace anyway), but not okay for logging unhandled\n * exceptions (because your catch block will likely be far away from the\n * inner function that actually caused the exception).\n *\n */\nTraceKit.computeStackTrace = (function computeStackTraceWrapper() {\n    var sourceCache = {};\n\n    /**\n     * Attempts to retrieve source code via XMLHttpRequest, which is used\n     * to look up anonymous function names.\n     * @param {string} url URL of source code.\n     * @return {string} Source contents.\n     */\n    function loadSource(url) {\n        if (!TraceKit.remoteFetching) { //Only attempt request if remoteFetching is on.\n            return '';\n        }\n        try {\n            var getXHR = function() {\n                try {\n                    return new window.XMLHttpRequest();\n                } catch (e) {\n                    // explicitly bubble up the exception if not found\n                    return new window.ActiveXObject('Microsoft.XMLHTTP');\n                }\n            };\n\n            var request = getXHR();\n            request.open('GET', url, false);\n            request.send('');\n            return request.responseText;\n        } catch (e) {\n            return '';\n        }\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * Retrieves source code from the source code cache.\n     * @param {string} url URL of source code.\n     * @return {Array.<string>} Source contents.\n     */\n    function getSource(url) {\n        if (!isString(url)) return [];\n        if (!hasKey(sourceCache, url)) {\n            // URL needs to be able to fetched within the acceptable domain.
